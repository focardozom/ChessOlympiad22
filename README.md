This package contains three datasets to analyze the performance of 937 players from 188 countries during the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India in 2022. The data has a multilevel structure, with players nested within countries and players nested within time. This makes it a helpful resource for practicing analysis of nested data in R.

Soon, you will find vignettes using the data. The planned vignettes include a CART analysis of differences in Elo and winning prediction (now included), as well as an analysis of the effect of peers on individual performance.

The ChessOlympiad package contains the following databases: Players, Teams, and Results. You can find more information about the tournament [here.](https://chess-results.com/tnr653631.aspx?lan=1&flag=30&turdet=YES)
