# ChessOlympiad22

This package contains three data sets to analyze the performance of 937 players from 188 countries during the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India, in 2022.

The data set has a multilevel structure (Players within countries and Payers within time). So it is helpful to practice analysis of nested data in R. 

Soon, you will find vignettes using the data. 

**Vignette planned:**

* CART analysis of differences in Elo and winning prediction. 
* Effect of peers on individual performance

The ChessOlympiad package contains the following databases.

* Players
